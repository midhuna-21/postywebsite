    "description": "A collective of astronomers that includes the participation of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have made new discoveries about how stars form in a far-off part of the Milky Way. The group of astronomical researchers studied the dense molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation. With the imaging precision of ALMA, they have identified structures of dust and gas at levels of detail never seen before. They have described not only the complex structures of the material, but the complex motions of it as they collapse into forming protostars. The paper emphasizes that stars do not form in isolation, but form in an environment of other stars, while interacting with the surrounding clusters, modifying the gas and dust regions from which they will emerge. Scientists say these results provide information on changes in the Milky Way throughout its life while also presenting a comparative method to study external galaxies. This discovery represents a substantial leap for science of astrophysics, and emphasizes how upcoming telescopes such as ALMA can study the earliest and most elusive episodes in the origins of stars, provide access to understanding how stars and eventually planetary systems began to form.",
